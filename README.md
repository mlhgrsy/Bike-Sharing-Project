# Bike-Sharing-Project
Using Bike Sharing Data Set, I created detailed graphs for the data set.
Using these graphs, formulated some hypothesis and examined their truthness. These hypothesis allowed me to
work on the prediction of the popularity of a new song using Machine Learning algorithms such as KNN and
Random Forest with 86% accuracy.
